### Main Interface
The red counter shows total watermarks found:
```
🔴 5  ← Click to rescan, hover for details
```

### Statistics Popup
Hover the counter to see detailed breakdown:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Watermarks Detected: 5      │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ U+200B Zero Width Space  3  │
│ U+00AD Soft Hyphen       2  │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Page Highlighting
Watermarks appear as red "W" markers with tooltips:
```
This is normal text W followed by more text
                   ↑
            (Zero Width Space)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: The counter doesn't appear**
- Make sure Tampermonkey is enabled
- Check if the website has watermarks to detect
- Try refreshing the page

**Q: LinkedIn content not loading properly**
- The script includes LinkedIn-specific optimizations
- Try clicking the counter to manually rescan
- Disable other userscripts temporarily to test conflicts

**Q: Too many false positives**
- Some websites use legitimate invisible characters
- The script distinguishes between normal formatting and watermarks
- Check the statistics popup for character details

**Q: Performance issues**
- The script is optimized for minimal impact
- On very large pages, scanning may take a moment
- Use manual rescan (click counter) if needed
